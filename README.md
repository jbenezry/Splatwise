2. How do I render the other errors:
  - Email address can't be blank
  - Please enter a valid email address.
  - Password is too common (e.g. '12345', 'password', etc) - please choose something more complex or unique
    # don't worry about latter two checks
3. What do I do with 'invalid credentials' message in sessions_controller.rb?
  # change to Whoops! We couldnâ€™t find an account for that email address and password.
4. Why am I still seeing a message in console that reads: 'livereload.js?host=localhost:191 WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:35729/livereload' failed: Unknown reason'?  I deleted my guard file, removed the 4 guard gems from my Gemfile, then ran bundle install, and even removed the corresponding line from config/environments/development.rb
5. Show Connor my interesting bug log
